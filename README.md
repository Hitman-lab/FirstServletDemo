# FirstServletDemo
This is a small Project where I've used servlet API to redirect the page into google.com(it's kind of like search engine but it's not) by using sendRedirect method,.

> **First Page**

**whaever we type inside this search box which will redirect to the google search**<br>
**we are using sendRedirect method to send request to google server with the request data.**
